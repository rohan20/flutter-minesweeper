# Minesweeper

A basic minesweeper game built using Flutter.

### Demo:

![Demo](https://github.com/rohan20/flutter-minesweeper/blob/master/demo_1.gif)

### To Do:

1. Add Facebook Auth
2. Use Facebook Auth to maintain high-scores with Firebase's Cloud Firestore
3. Add game levels (which updates mine count)
4. Add 'How to play' section since the long-press to add flag action isn't intuitive
5. Show world rankings based on high-scores
6. Restrict timer time and hardcode the widget size
7. Get rid of the default Material Theme = Platform independent UI
