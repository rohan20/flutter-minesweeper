# Minesweeper

A basic minesweeper game built using Flutter.

### To Do:

1. Add Facebook Auth
2. Use Facebook Auth to maintain high-scores with Firestore
3. Add game levels (which updates mine count)
4. Add 'How to play' section since the long-press to add flag action isn't intuitive
5. Show world rankings baseed on high-scores
